ASG Runtime is a Python library providing runtime support for SFDPs (Shared Federated Data Products) generated with the ASG tool.  
This library handles the heavy lifting needed to realize SFDP functionality, while allowing SFDP servers to stay slim and uniform through templating.

## Features

ASG Runtime provides support for:

- [x] Parsing endpoint specifications generated by the ASG-tool.
- [x] Fetching data from origin FDPs using async `httpx`, supporting timeouts, retries, pagination, and caching headers.
- [x] Realizing data transformations as prescribed by the endpoint specification, including loading and invoking methods from the `transforms` library.
- [ ] **TODO:** Observing and managing the `transforms` library at runtime.
- [x] Two-level caching:  
  - `origin cache` to store responses from origin FDPs,  
  - `response cache` to store computed SFDP responses.
- [x] Providing operational statistics, including cache hits/misses, HTTP client stats, etc.
- [ ] **TODO:** Publishing telemetry in Prometheus-compatible format.
- [x] Returning data from SFDP endpoints as ORJSON-encoded datasets.
- [x] Logging and error reporting.

## Usage

The library is designed to be present in environments where ASG-generated SFDPs are deployed.

Installation can be done from sources using standard Python methods, such as:
- Installing directly from a Git repository,
- Installing from local sources,
- Installing from a built package.

For detailed usage instructions on local usage, see [docs/local_usage.md](./docs/local_usage.md).

At the moment, no public installable package is planned.  

Additionally, the library is packaged into a pre-baked container image used by the ASG system to create templated SFDP instances. To use the image, use the following in your SFDP's Dockerfile:

TODO - change to a real gitlab url
```sh
# for the latest build
FROM registry.gitlab.com/<yourgroup>/asg-runtime:latest 

# for the concrete release
FROM registry.gitlab.com/<yourgroup>/asg-runtime:<version> 
```

## Releases

The library releases are versioned to help keeping the whole ASG system that includes the ASG-tool for generating the templated ASG-SFDP apps, the generated apps, and the ASG Library. Release process is described in [./docs/release.md](./docs/release.md).
