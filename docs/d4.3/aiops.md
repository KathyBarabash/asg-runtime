🔗 Recommended Transitional Paragraph (end of your section):

To further enhance the operational capabilities of SFDPs and the TEADAL infrastructure at large, the platform integrates intelligent monitoring and optimization strategies. These are driven by rich runtime metadata and AI-based analysis pipelines. In the next section, we present the AI-Driven Performance Monitoring (AI-DPM) framework developed by Almaviva. This system complements the Stretched Data Lakes by enabling proactive resource management, anomaly detection, and performance prediction across the TEADAL Nodes — all critical to achieving the platform’s trust, sustainability, and efficiency goals.
✅ Additional Integration Tips:

    Terminology consistency: Since “Stretched Data Lakes” and “Control Plane” are your domain, and “AI-DPM” is the monitoring layer, suggest referring to AI-DPM as a monitoring and optimization subsystem of the TEADAL Control Plane where applicable (even in their section, if they’re open to edits).

    Logical narrative progression:
        Your section ends by talking about runtime telemetry and optimization.
        Their section begins with metadata types, collection, and insights — this is a natural continuation if we emphasize how telemetry flows into AI-DPM.

    Keep them aligned with SFDP relevance: If any AI models specifically help evaluate performance of SFDPs (e.g., latency prediction, TEE impact), encourage that these be explicitly mentioned. It will strengthen the cohesion of the report.

Would you like a visual outline of the full architecture (how SFDPs, Control Plane, and AI-DPM relate), or do you already have one?
